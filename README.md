# TDM-PCM-System-Development-in-Proteus
This project presents a TDM-PCM system designed and simulated in Proteus. It processes multiple analog inputs through sampling, quantization, PCM encoding, and TDM transmission. At the receiver, signals are decoded, converted back to analog form, and separated into their original channels.
